# OperatingSystem

OperatingSystem Courses, Lectures and Programs.

This Repo is almost based on [MIT 6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/schedule.html), and the rest is based on my [college courses](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/OU_Assignment/blob/main/B2/%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%A0%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0/README.md).

# Lab

This Repo would just take notes about MIT 6.828 Lecture, and I would implement Lab in the other Repo:
