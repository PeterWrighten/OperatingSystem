# OperatingSystem

OperatingSystem Courses, Lectures and Programs.

This Repo is almost based on [MIT 6.S081](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html) and OSTEP, and the rest is based on my [college courses](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/OU_Assignment/blob/main/B2/%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%A0%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0/README.md).

# Todo List

- [ ] [Batch System](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/OperatingSystem/tree/chap2/peter_os_batch)

# Lab

In Lab part of this repository, I would implement a mini OS called peter_os.

[rCorePeterOS](./rcore-peter-os)

Because this OS is a course's lab in THU, I would also finish the course in following repository:
