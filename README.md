# OperatingSystem

OperatingSystem Courses, Lectures and Programs.

This Repo is almost based on [MIT 6.S081](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html) and OSTEP, and the rest is based on my [college courses](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/OU_Assignment/blob/main/B2/%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%A0%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0/README.md).

# Lab

This Repo would just take notes about MIT 6.S081 Lecture, and I would implement Lab in the other Repo:

[MIT 6.S081 Lab](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/MIT_6.S081_Lab)



Lab's Reference: [OSTEP](https://github.com/PeterWrighten/ostep-homework)

If it is possible, I also wanna try re-implementing this OS
by Rust. (An ambitious purpose)

[RUST XV6]()
